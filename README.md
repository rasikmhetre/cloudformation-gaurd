This repository contains a set of CloudFormation Guard (CFN-Guard) rules to enforce best practices in your AWS CloudFormation templates. These rules ensure that your CloudFormation stacks follow security and compliance standards by checking various resource configurations, such as LogicalId naming conventions, EBS root volume encryption, and S3 bucket encryption. Below is an overview of the rules included in the repository:

1. LogicalId Naming Convention Rule
Goal: Enforce consistent naming conventions for resource logical IDs.

Rule: Ensure that the LogicalId of resources contains the last two components of the AWS resource type. For example:

AWS::EC2::Instance should have a LogicalId ending with Ec2Instance.
AWS::S3::Bucket should have a LogicalId ending with S3Bucket.
AWS::Lambda::Function should have a LogicalId ending with LambdaFunction.
Why it Matters: This rule helps ensure that LogicalId names are more intuitive and make it easier to identify resource types just by looking at their names.

Example:

Valid: MyEc2Instance
Invalid: MyInstance or MyEc2 or MyInstanceEc2
2. EBS Root Volume Encryption Rule
Goal: Ensure that EC2 instances have encrypted root EBS volumes.

Rule: Checks that the root volume of EC2 instances is encrypted. The root volume is defined as the volume where the operating system is stored (typically /dev/sda1 or /dev/xvda).

Why it Matters: Encryption of root volumes ensures that sensitive data on EC2 instances is protected at rest.

Example:

yaml
Copy code
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      BlockDeviceMappings:
        - DeviceName: /dev/sda1
          Ebs:
            Encrypted: true
Non-compliant Example: A root volume without encryption.
3. S3 Bucket Encryption Rule
Goal: Ensure that all S3 buckets are configured to use encryption.

Rule: Ensures that all S3 buckets have encryption enabled. The rule verifies that the BucketEncryption property is present and configured correctly.

Why it Matters: Enabling encryption on S3 buckets ensures that any data stored is automatically encrypted at rest, protecting sensitive information.

Example:

yaml
Copy code
Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionMethod: AES256
Non-compliant Example: An S3 bucket without encryption enabled.
4. Rule Examples:
Here are the full examples of each rule implementation using CFN-Guard:

cfn
Copy code
# 1. LogicalId Naming Convention Rule
rule check_logical_id_format {
    Resources[Type == "AWS::EC2::Instance"].LogicalId == /.*Ec2Instance$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::S3::Bucket"].LogicalId == /.*S3Bucket$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::Lambda::Function"].LogicalId == /.*LambdaFunction$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::RDS::DBInstance"].LogicalId == /.*DBInstance$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::S3::BucketPolicy"].LogicalId == /.*BucketPolicy$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::IAM::Policy"].LogicalId == /.*Policy$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup"].LogicalId == /.*AutoScalingGroup$/
  or
    Resources[Type == "AWS::ECS::Cluster"].LogicalId == /.*EcsCluster$/
}

# 2. EBS Root Volume Encryption Rule
rule check_ebs_root_volume_encryption {
    Resources[Type == "AWS::EC2::Instance"].Properties.BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.Encrypted == true
}

# 3. S3 Bucket Encryption Rule
rule check_s3_bucket_encryption {
    Resources[Type == "AWS::S3::Bucket"].Properties.BucketEncryption.ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration[*].ServerSideEncryptionMethod IN ["AES256", "aws:kms"]
}
How the Rules Work:
LogicalId Naming Convention Rule:

This rule ensures that the LogicalId of resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, etc., follows a naming convention that makes the resource type easily identifiable. It checks that the LogicalId ends with the last two components of the resource type.
EBS Root Volume Encryption Rule:

This rule validates that EC2 instances have encrypted root volumes. The root volume is the volume that holds the operating system, and encryption ensures data protection at rest.
S3 Bucket Encryption Rule:

This rule ensures that all S3 buckets in the CloudFormation template have encryption enabled. It verifies that the BucketEncryption property is set correctly, using either AES256 or AWS KMS encryption.
How to Use CFN-Guard Rules:
Install CFN-Guard:

You can install CFN-Guard by following the instructions on the official GitHub repository.
Validate Your CloudFormation Template:

To run the validation, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
cfn-guard validate -r <rules-file> -t <template-file>
For example:
bash
Copy code
cfn-guard validate -r compliant_logical_id.guard -t template.yaml
Fix Non-compliant Templates:

If CFN-Guard detects any non-compliant resources in the template, it will provide a report, and you can adjust the template accordingly to comply with the rules.
Why These Rules Matter:
Security Compliance: Ensuring encryption for S3 buckets and EBS volumes ensures that sensitive data is protected.
Resource Organization: The LogicalId naming convention makes the CloudFormation template more readable, helping teams understand the type of resource at a glance.
Best Practices: These rules ensure that CloudFormation templates follow AWS best practices and avoid common pitfalls related to resource naming and data encryption.
